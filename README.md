QuestionReview
==============
Alpha website which hopes to serve a friend's need to collaboratively submit and review questions with his classmates. At the moement, there are two main pages:
- Question
- Review

Question
========
The question page takes a form and sends the data to Parse.com for database hosting. At the moment, no one else has access to this data other than myself.

Review
======
The review page will take a question and display, giving feedback if the answer selected is correct (True) or wrong (False).  Haven't incorporated the work to pull the data from Parse, using 3 random question I made.
Have added self-explanatory Next, Previous, Random buttons to browse through questions.
